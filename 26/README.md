# Map Filter Reduce - Whiteboard 26

* Map - Takes an array, makes a copy of that array and performs a callback function on each index returning the copy once each index has been manipulated as requested.

* Filter - Takes an array, makes a copy of that array and performs a callback using the values of the array and determines whether the cb returns true, if so it adds the value to an array to return, then returns the array of true values once each index has been evaluated as requested.

* Reduce - Takes an array, makes a copy of that array and performs a callback using the indexs of the array and an accumulator, then returns the accumulated value once each index has been manipulated as requested.
